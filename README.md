This project is a branch of HTML5 Boilerplate.

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

The HTML5 Boilerplate project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined community knowledge. 
It does not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way 
that you want.
