This project is a branch of HTML5 Boilerplate.

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end skeleton for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

[Closure Tools](https://developers.google.com/closure/) and more specifically the the [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
can play a huge roll in the development of your project, if you choose to take advantage of them. By default, the Closure Compiler serves as the HTML 
compressor, CSS-linter, compressor and compiler, running SASS or LESS, based on the ant settings.
